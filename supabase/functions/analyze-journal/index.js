Based on the entry, provide:
1. A brief, empathetic response acknowledging their feelings
2. One specific, actionable suggestion that could help them
3. Frame the suggestion as a question about whether they'd like a reminder
4. Categorize your suggestion into one of these types: ${suggestionTypes.join(", ")}
5. Use emoji to make your response friendly and conversational
6. Keep your response concise and chat-like, as if you're messaging in WhatsApp

Format your response as a JSON object with these fields:
{
  "type": "one of the suggestion types",
  "response": "your empathetic response and suggestion with emoji"
}

Example: "That sounds like a rough night ðŸ˜´. Would you like me to remind you to wind down at 10:30pm?"`
